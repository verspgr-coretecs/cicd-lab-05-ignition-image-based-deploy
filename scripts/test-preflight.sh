# Test harness for scripts/preflight.sh.
#
# Answers "can we test this without a Windows machine?" — yes, for everything
# that matters. The WSL permission problem is really a UID-mismatch problem,
# and a UID mismatch reproduces exactly in a Linux container: we create a
# non-root user, bind-mount a repo, let a root container write into it, and
# assert that the student user can still work.
#
# Two layers:
#   1. Unit tests (run anywhere, seconds): source preflight.sh with the
#      environment-probing functions stubbed, and assert each check fires.
#   2. Container tests (need Docker, ~1 min): a real non-root user in a real
#      container, reproducing the exact root-owned-bind-mount failure and
#      proving the compose fix removes it.
#
# What genuinely cannot be tested here: DrvFs itself (needs Windows) and
# /etc/wsl.conf being honoured (needs a WSL reboot). Those are covered by
# the fatal check + the manual checklist in docs/wsl-setup.md.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/test-preflight.sh           # unit tests only
#   scripts/test-preflight.sh --docker  # unit + container tests

# run_case takes shell code as a single-quoted string; expansion is deliberately
# deferred to the eval inside run_case, not the call site.
