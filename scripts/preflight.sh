# Host preflight — WSL/permission sanity checks shared by every lab.
#
# Sourced by setup.sh BEFORE anything touches Docker or the working tree.
# Its whole job is to make sure that, by the time the gateway containers start
# writing into the bind-mounted repo, the student's own user can still read,
# edit, commit and delete every one of those files WITHOUT sudo.
#
# The four things that break this on Windows, in the order they bite:
#
#   1. The clone lives on /mnt/c (a DrvFs mount of the Windows filesystem).
#      There, the files are governed by Windows ACLs mapped through WSL's uid
#      translation. chown/chmod inside WSL do not stick, Docker bind mounts are
#      slow and lose permission bits, and running WSL as a Windows admin
#      "fixes" it only by sidestepping the ACL — which is exactly the
#      workaround two students landed on. This is FATAL: we refuse to run and
#      tell them to move the clone into the WSL filesystem (~).
#
#   2. /etc/wsl.conf has no `metadata` automount option, so DrvFs cannot store
#      a uid/gid/mode at all. Only relevant once (1) is satisfied, but we still
#      write it so a stray /mnt/c checkout of some OTHER repo behaves.
#
#   3. The containers run as root and write root-owned files into the bind
#      mount. Fixed at the source: compose now runs the gateway as the image's
#      own user with the student's group added (`user: "2003:0"` +
#      `group_add: ${LAB_GID}` — see the export below and section 3), so
#      nothing root-owned is ever created.
#
#   4. Damage already done by earlier runs (root-owned files from before this
#      fix, or from a sudo'd setup.sh) still sits in the tree. We detect it and
#      reclaim it — using sudo ONLY for that one repair, and only with consent.

# 3. Export the gid the gateway containers should run as.

# docker-compose.yaml uses this as a supplementary group:

#
# Why 2003 and not the student's uid: the Ignition image already runs as its
# own non-root user (uid 2003, "ignition") and the image's /usr/local/bin/
# ignition/data tree is owned by it. Forcing an arbitrary host uid makes that
# tree unwritable and the gateway fails to boot — verified: the bind mount
# becomes writable but data/ does not.
#
# So we keep uid 2003 and instead join the container to the STUDENT'S GROUP.
# Combined with the group-write + setgid bits applied below, that means:
#   - the gateway can write data/ (it is still uid 2003), and
#   - everything it writes into the bind mount lands group-owned by the
#     student, mode 664/775, so the student can edit and delete it.
# No root-owned files anywhere, so no sudo, ever.
#
# Docker Desktop on macOS virtualises bind-mount ownership, so this is inert
# there; on WSL2 and native Linux it is what removes the problem.

# (the lab 05 image deploy, recreating the runner, the lab 07 test profile) —
# usually from a fresh terminal where LAB_GID is unset. Compose then falls back
# to group_add 0 and, because the config hash changed, RECREATES the gateway
# without the student's group, and its writes into the bind mounts start
# failing again. Compose reads .env from the project dir on every invocation,
# so recording the value once here fixes every later manual run.
# (A real environment variable still takes precedence over .env, so the export
# above stays authoritative inside setup.sh itself.)
